# WP-CRAP

_WordPress Customizer Remove All Parts allows you to get the Customizer crap out of your WordPress install. It prevents any Customizer scripts from loading and removes all links and buttons to Customizer in the dashboard and admin toolbar._

### Installation

Upload WP CRAP to your blog or use the dashboard to Add New plugins and activate it. That's it! No options needed. Customizer is gone.
